## Problem
The department of specific sciency matters has a science Education sub-department that wants to create software to improve science education. One area of science education that is not easily accesiable for younger kids is computer science.

## Solution
To improve engadgment in computer science amongst kids, we want to create software that will make learning computer science concepts fun and interactive in a relatable way. A major section of computer science is learning and understanding how computers work on a lower level. Logic gates is an essential learning step in understanding the inner workings of computers. Nowadays video games make up a large portion of kids time and intrests. We want to leverage this to help make learning about computer science more fun.

Minecraft is a world building game most popular amoung a younger auduience. Minecraft has a powerful mechanic called redstone which can eseintially represent eletrical components. Inparticular, logic gates are  easily represented using the redstone mechanics. By allowing users of LogiCraftâ„¢ to create and convert logic gate schematics into a minecraft world, users can see a visualisation and begin to explore and understand logic gates in a familiar context.
